# RUS-Sim Visuals

Complete source code for RUS Sim will come out soon.

RUS-Sim is a simulation developed specifically for robotic ultrasound imaging applications. The ultrasound robot platform was previously developed in [Medical FUSIONLAB](https://wp.wpi.edu/medicalfusionlab) at Worcester Polytechnic Insitute, and was digital twinned into RUS-Sim. It includes many automation features such as [automatic probe normal positioning](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9932673) and [ultrasound image based probe servoing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11523), etc. The simulation features real-time ultrasound simulation based on preoperative patinet CT data.
